Pleb is a very simple local-network oriented video streaming site. All you have to do is throw an MP4 or other compatible video file into a specified directory, and it will show up in a list of streamable videos in the browser interface. That's it. No fancy client. No fancy database. Nothing. Just stick a file in a directory and watch it in your browser.
